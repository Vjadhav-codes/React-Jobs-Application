📌 Project Timeline & Professional Assurance

“This project was developed between August–October 2025 and continues to be improved as I refine features, performance, and UI interactions. While some parts are still in progress, the current build already demonstrates my core front-end skills, problem-solving ability, and attention to detail. If given the opportunity, I am fully capable of delivering complete, production-ready features with the same consistency, quality, and technical discipline shown in this work.”

This communicates:

No confusion about upload timing

Confidence in my skills

Ownership and maturity

Ability to deliver results

Commitment to continuous improvement

🌐 Live Deployment (Vercel)
