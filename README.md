React Jobs Web Application

A full CRUD job-management platform built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and JSON Server.
This project demonstrates practical front-end engineering skills including component architecture, routing, state management, API handling, responsive UI, and production-grade deployment workflows.

Project Timeline & Professional Context

This application was developed between August–October 2025 and continues to be improved as I enhance features, refine performance, and expand UI capabilities.

The deployed version demonstrates my front-end fundamentals, problem-solving ability, and clean component design.
I take full ownership of my projects and can deliver complete, production-ready features with the same discipline and consistency shown here.
